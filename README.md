Reflecting on My Internship Journey at JYSK: Unveiling Sales Insights Through Data Analysis

Background : JYSK is an international housing chain with Scandinavian roots, which makes it easy to furnish every room in every home as well as the garden.
With over 3,300 stores and webshops in 48 countries, JYSK always has a good offer and competent service nearby, regardless of how customers want to shop.

🌟 I wanted to take a moment to share the incredible experience I had as an intern at JYSK, where I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of data analysis and its applications in understanding sales dynamics.

🔍 Role Overview: Throughout my internship, I had the exciting role of handling and analyzing extensive sales data sets. My responsibilities involved using a mix of technical skills and analytical thinking to make sense of the data, turning it into actionable insights.

📊 Technical Toolbox: My journey was powered by Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Stats. I leveraged these tools to build data models, generate configuration files, and uncover patterns within the data. Visualizing these insights was made possible with Matplotlib and Seaborn, giving life to the numbers.

🚀 Key Achievements:

Spotting Trends: One of the highlights was collaborating with the data to uncover meaningful sales trends for the entire year of 2021. This information proved invaluable for strategic planning and decision-making.
Product Analysis: Another exciting aspect was conducting an in-depth analysis that revealed the top-performing and least-performing products. This analysis directly contributed to refining product strategies.
🌟 Personal Growth: Beyond the technical skills, this internship allowed me to grow as an individual and professional. I developed a deep appreciation for the insights data can provide and its role in shaping business strategies.
